I have also registered with 7 days free trial, then I forgot to cancel my subscription and my card have been charged. For this reason I reached out to them and kindly asked to refund my money. It`s true that their reply takes up to 24 hours but we have to focus on the result. They have refunded despite the fact that they were right.  because it was totally my fault."},

I subscribed to the subscription with a 30% discount offered by dropship.io. Following that, due to a misunderstanding, my subscription was canceled, which is not at all what I intended. Despite several emails and unsatisfactory responses, they don't seem to understand, and it's impossible to reach someone who cares. They don't seem capable to offer the same discount that I had before. It's really unfortunate because I'm interested in their services, but they don't seem to care about an interested customer. Very disappointing."},

They obviously need to scam people when the product is that bad."},
